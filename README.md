# Exam_TimeSeries

University of Texas at San Antonio
Data Analytics Program

Exam 2 of Practicum I (course from the Master's in Data Analytics program). The objective of this exam was to select two different data sets (one without seasonality and the other with seasonality) and examine each data set.

My first data set without seasonality was about the number of earthquakes per year with magnitude 7.0 or greater from 1900-1998 in the United States. My second data set with seasonality was on the temperature (in Kelvin) in San Antonio from 2013 - 2017 taken every hour of every day.

The Word document Exam2_TimeSeriesAnalysis includes more details about all the analysis done on both data sets and every step taken. All analysis was done in R and the code is included in the file Exam2_TimesSeries.RMD. More information on the data sets is available upon request.
